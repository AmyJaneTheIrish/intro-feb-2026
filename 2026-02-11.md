# Writing code
- About 40% of writing code is writing tests

# Quiz
- COOL - "C-based OOO"

1 **When you compile a .NET project, it produces an _assembly_, which is a combination of metadata about the types produced, and the _IL_ (_intermediate language_) that the .NET Runtime (CLR) executes.**
    - JVM:JAVA::CLR:DotNet - Supports Visual Basic .NET -C#, also has a functional language named F#
2 **The major difference between ".NET Core" and what we now call ".NET Framework" is:**
    - Core is cross platform and open source, Framework is windows only
    - .NET Framework - the non-cross platform version will never* get to version 5
3 True or _FALSE_: .NET is commercial software and you must pay a license to Microsoft to develop code using .NET.
4 True or _FALSE_: .NET code must be created using Microsoft Visual Studio, though a free version is available.
5 **What is a solution in .NET?**
    - A glorified folder, holds projects. Holds configuration things
    - FOREVER the file format for solutions was the same, and it was a *mess*. There were *.snl files and they had a ton of confusing stuff in it, and would constantly casue merge conflicts that were hard to fix, etc
    - VERY recently (<6 months ago) they released a new version (*.slnx) that is much better, cleaner
    - As of .NET 10, that is the "Default" for new projects and solutions
6 **What is the purpose of Aspire? At least as far as we are using it.**
    - Distributed Application Development. Helps us run and deploy the different applications we have in one nice place.
    - Supports the 'best practice' of Dev/prod parity from the 12 factor app - orchestrates containers, all that stuff
7 **What are the three main things we design when designing an HTTP API?**
    -1). Resources (endpoints).
    -2). Methods (actions, ie GET POST PUT DELETE)
    -3). Formats/Representations (req/res structures)
8 **What is meant by the term "Service" as we are using it in our development?**
    - Code that owns some data and all processes around that data
    - This is pretty much his definition of a "microservice" as well
9 **What is the difference between using the HTTP protocol scheme and the HTTPS protocol scheme?**
    - The s, or the encrypted later between server/client communication
    - HTTPS is "Transport Layer Security" - tis
10 **What is a "port" in TCP networking?**
    - Port where TCP is lsitening to incoming requests
    - Each application listening on a particular server that uses TCP must have a unique port
        - There are "standard" or well-known ports:
            - http is 80
            - https is 443
            - mail (smtp) 25
            - sql server 1433
            - postgres 5432

# Questions
- .NET something
    - .NET is new! (2002)
    - Web application are ASP.NET Web Forms
        - "Active Server Pages"
    - Distributed applications are: 
        - XML Web Services (SOAP)
            - "asmx" files
        - ".NET Remoting"
            - Super poorly documented
            - .NET Components
    - Windows Communication Foundation (2008)
        - Doubling down on SOAP messaging
        - BIG DEAL
        - Our* entire infrastructure was this
    - Web Forms Suck! Replace with ASP.NET MVC (2016)
        - Much closer to the metal - you had to know HTML, all tha, but that gave you more power
    - DHH - Ruby On Rails
        - He borrowed a PATTERN from the smalltalk & adapted it to the web
        - "Model View Controller"
        - This is a great model for stateful applications, but the web is stateless, so it is a ittle weird
        - Model
        - View
        - Controller: Traffic cop, some code that gets the rquest, and 
            - Either creates the "model"
            - Returns a view* of that model

    - "WCF is NO MORE, ASP.Net Web.Api is IN
    - *Controller*: Framework...code that other people create that we build on top off
    - *Reflection* scans through all the code and searches for particular things
        - Is slow
    - *If your code is calling outside your API project across a network (dbs, other services, etc), you MUST use async/await*
    - HTTP is a stateless protocol
    - *Garbage collector (in .NET)*: 
        - Non-halting (code can keep running)
        - Generational (it's pretty smart)  -- at 4:30 he can explain more if we're interested
        - Non-deterministic
    - Q: What are some books or YT videos we could watch about .NET ((MODERN))
    - C++ or Rust or Linux, or something runs FAST because they have NO runtime, not Java VM involved, just no runtime but dangerous
    - Native applciations: non-runtime, no JVM, no CLR (common language runtime), start up time
    - Some APIs are started on demand. So-called "Serverless"
        - Amazon Lambda, Azure Function, KNative, etc
    - AOT: Ahead of time compilation 
    - Native is slimmer, less services. Not all can be compiled ahead of time. 
        - Does NOT support reflection
    - Q: ASP.NET explained
    - Moving away from the controller things, but progressive still has it. But can't take advantage of new stuff
        - "new developements should probably not sue controllers, take advantage of new stuff" - his prediction
    - Web SDK - prob gonna be working with that

# Database stuff
1. Info to connect to database (server, credentials, etc) - ConnectionStrings
    - Configuration (the part of our app that changes by environment)
2. Open a Connection
    - Some library/package specific for that database
    - EntityFramework - relational db, easiest by far is you are following the current industry best praactice - Apps don't share dbs
    - Something lighter, and a popular choice is *dapper*
    - NoSql dbs like MongoDb, etc, means the db is not going to enforce rules about data consistence AT ALL (just boxes you can throw data in)
        - If you are sharing this kind of db with other applications, it's probably gonna hurt
3. Run a  Query, wait for results or Run a command
4. Close Connection
5. Process results, send response, etc

# Backing Service (DB, API, etc)
1. async/await
2. let the db provider manage connections

1. When we have an app that might be processing thousands of requests an hour against a single db. It'll do optimizations like *connection pooling*
2. Networks (Breaks a lot)
    - SRE (sight reliability engineering)


# In VS but I want to make sure I have it in case it changes  (Program.cs)
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("tacos") ?? throw new Exception("No Connection String");
// Gonna look in different places to find the connection string "tacos"
// 1st palce is: appsettings.json -> "ConnectionString": { "tacos": "...." } 
// 2nd place is: See if there is an environment variable on the machine you're running on called "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT"
// Look for an appsettings.Environment.json and use that value (in launchSettings.json)
// 3rd place: Looks at environment variables - ConnectionStrings__tacos



Session.store is Martins way of adding things to that transaction of things that need to be updated

Opening something and then https://mm-api-apphost.dev.localhost:1337/openapi/v1.json

endpoint that reaches out to a differnet thingasync goes on a fucntion and the await 
- Standard format for APIs is
