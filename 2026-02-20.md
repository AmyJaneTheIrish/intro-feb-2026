Disabling buttons is bad, screen readers can't tab to them

Attributes aren't verified in Angular <button tacos="delicious"></button>  but can't do anything with them
<button [attr.aria-disabled]="form().invalid() || form().submitting()"></button>
zod doesn't have a way to say soemthing is required (To get around it, you have to say it has a min length, or say it's optional)

Usually put the providers in the routes, when you put it on a componenets provider, only available inside of this component or any of the children. When you move off of it and come back it reloads the data

# APIs
zod gen is like getting that from the api
Mapping to a late bound call, there's no guarantee it's gonna map
Anytime you remove a thing, change the meaning of a thing, or add a new thing, and it is required
    - You are possibly breaking clients.... once an api is deployed, it gonna be difficult to change because so many apps depend on it
    - You can add new stuff to the API tho
        - That is the secret message of the string calculator, just write enough for the requirements RIGHT NOW... premature additions are very difficult to change

TS only works at compile time, it will compile if q.content, it's living in a fantasy
- If you don't trsut apis, or failure is an option, make sure to validate the data!

Compile errors but not runtime errors in TS

Going outside process space, use async and await
