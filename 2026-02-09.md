# 2026-02-09

**Two things we need to do on our end**
1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your ntoes & identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below. Before you leave for the day - do this.

2. Every morning after today we will start with Jeff asking a random selection of you this question:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yesterday
    - What was cool and you want to know more about

**Other notes:**
- Keyboard shortcuts
- `Ctrl+P` - Find Anything
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` - Command Palette    -- run on any command in VSC
- example, look up terminal
- ``Ctrl+` `` - Open a terminal  
- `Ctrl+Alt+F` - Filter the Explorer menu
- He's using Foam as an extension

Q: Different between Ctrl+P and Ctrl+Shift+P, what is the Command Palette
Jeff talked about [[Markdown]]  Or just do [[here it is]] with nothing in it to use as a placeholder

- Excalibur files
- *TFS (Team Foundation Server)*: A MS tool for source code control (NOT Git)
    - It is centralized version control. It is bad, Progressive trying to get away from it
- *Git*: Decentralized, ANARACHY!!
    - Idea is get your original copy of this stuff from that origin and start right
    - Then they wanted some centrality....that's where GitHub came in
    - Move "origin" severs to GitHub, let people collaborate
- *Azure DevOps!* Aka ADO
    - For big companies
    - Can manage this stuff, stricter than GitHub
    - Host & run continuous integration & continuous delivery or deployment scenarios
    - BUT MS bought GitHub
    - His estimate is that Azure will slowly get absorbed by GitHub
- *What do you store in git?*
    - Code that you and your team OWN and change
    - Don't store other stuff there
        - Libraries you use (dlls {MS version of shared libraries}, etc)
        - Other teams code
        - Even things like images, stuff like that
Q. What is the Twelve Factor App - I see it on screen but I don't remember what he said
Q: What is a solion vs project name

- How can I have all source code AND all the history on every machine?
    - You have the current version you've fetched
    - You have "deltas" (patches) of all changes
    - Usually that isn' too much
    - PolicyPro was amazing, but it was way too big

**Some commands (don't need to do these again)**
git config --global user.name "AmyJane Reilly" also did that to the email
gh auth login
git init
explorer .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial"
