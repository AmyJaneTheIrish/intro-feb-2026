# 2026-02-09

**Two things we need to do on our end**
1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your ntoes & identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below. Before you leave for the day - do this.

2. Every morning after today we will start with Jeff asking a random selection of you this question:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yesterday
    - What was cool and you want to know more about

**Other notes:**
- Keyboard shortcuts
- `Ctrl+P` - Find Anything
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` - Command Palette    -- run on any command in VSC
- example, look up terminal
- ``Ctrl+` `` - Open a terminal  
- `Ctrl+Alt+F` - Filter the Explorer menu
- He's using Foam as an extension

Q: Different between Ctrl+P and Ctrl+Shift+P, what is the Command Palette
Jeff talked about [[Markdown]]  Or just do [[here it is]] with nothing in it to use as a placeholder

- Excalibur files
- *TFS (Team Foundation Server)*: A MS tool for source code control (NOT Git)
    - It is centralized version control. It is bad, Progressive trying to get away from it
- *Git*: Decentralized, ANARACHY!!
    - Idea is get your original copy of this stuff from that origin and start right
    - Then they wanted some centrality....that's where GitHub came in
    - Move "origin" severs to GitHub, let people collaborate
- *Azure DevOps!* Aka ADO
    - For big companies
    - Can manage this stuff, stricter than GitHub
    - Host & run continuous integration & continuous delivery or deployment scenarios
    - BUT MS bought GitHub
    - His estimate is that Azure will slowly get absorbed by GitHub
- *What do you store in git?*
    - Code that you and your team OWN and change
    - Don't store other stuff there
        - Libraries you use (dlls {MS version of shared libraries}, etc)
        - Other teams code
        - Even things like images, stuff like that
Q. What is the Twelve Factor App - I see it on screen but I don't remember what he said
Q: What is a solion vs project name

- How can I have all source code AND all the history on every machine?
    - You have the current version you've fetched
    - You have "deltas" (patches) of all changes
    - Usually that isn' too much
    - PolicyPro was amazing, but it was way too big

**Some commands (don't need to do these again)**
git config --global user.name "AmyJane Reilly" also did that to the email
gh auth login
git init
explorer .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial"   Takes a copy and puts it into GitHub (This is the offical copy/origin)
gh repo create
gh browse

**Source control on left side**
- Make a commit message
- Stage changes 
- Commit

*Continuing on*
- Pull his code with this command: *./pull-instructor-code.sh* 
- Then go to the diff folders and grab his code
- In class folder there are 2 directories. one is instructor code & one is intro
    - After he pushes his code, it's available for me
    - I can pull it and go to `Diff Folders` in left panel
- Fetch frequently and push at least daily
    - Get the latest changes as oftenas you can
    - Don't let code ferment on your machine
- Structure your app and code in a way that no 2 devs should have any excuse to work on the same file at the same time
    - Why we tend to have "lots of small files"
    - Organizing code base around "business features" instead of technical concerns
- "libs" - libraries. Storing binaries, dependencies all that WAS a good practice, found out it isn't so good
- *History*
    - *TCA Framework* is a framework that Progressive created, in the late 1990s
        - Was used for part of .NET down the line
        - Now it...isn't the best lol
    - Cloud was also very distruptive
    - Distributed apps will use the SOAP protocol
    - We will be a "Microsoft" shop - .NET, all that
    - IBM Mainframe, very good, very reliable 
    - .NET Framework (old skool) cannot run there and the way we deal with data, that's a problem too
    - A big company should have a single point of truth for all their data. Big honking db, with stored procedures, rules, & the SMART people work on that
        - DB2: IBM Mainframe
- *Environments*
    - All the different places your code runs
    - Places where the configuration is different
    - Goal: Always have the same code running in each environemtn from left to right as much as possible
    - *Production*: The only environment that counts
        - Other environments include Development, Test/Staging
    - Finite selection of dbs for you and your team to choose from. 
        - DB2, SQL Server, MongoDB, Postgres, Cloud Offerings
    - In OpenShift there are thousands of ... something running
    - Q: Explain OpenShift in this process
    - Q: Why shift from *TFS to Git*? Git is better because it is distributed, as opposed to centralized
        - Git you have your own copy, you can keep on working. Ex. when GitHub was down we can still work
    - *SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)*: Primary architecture of many companies
    - *Containers* (aka Docker): let you run software that: 
        - Won't break other things on your machine (they're in a protective container)
        - And match what you have in other environments (dev/prod parity)
    - We want containers to run "doubles" of our backing services that are in production
        - Scripts that just run different containers
        docker has a thing called "docker compose" that lets you run a bunch of things
    - "Aspire": lets you create a local dev env AND make it so that it can be deployed
        - We won't be doing the deploying part
        - Up and running is all of these places: Kubernetes, Docker Compse, AWS, Azure
    - *Project*: Like an app
    - *Solution*: Like a workspace


    I missed the Visual Studio stuff. Apphost and Gateway.Api
    - Wants AppHost to run Gateway.Api   
    - Also want Apphost to run MuddiestMoments Api
    - Apphost knows about those too, but they don't need to know each other. COUPLING
    - then he added more code in AppHost.cs
    Ctrl+F+5 in Visual Studio: It's building, compiling & saving the application
