- Still can't see the VS code with
- Apphost and Gateway.Api

- *Make sure you know what you're writing before you write good code*

## Getting the Instructor Code
Pro Tips:
- If you are in VS (not VS Code) just close it. Really. Bad things can happen.
- Open an integrated terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``) 
- Make sure you terminal working directory is "~/class/intro"
- Command: `./pull-instructor-code.sh`
- Then, can drag em in from file explorer.
 OR go to diff folders and find it there
