- Testing. How do we "simulate and verify" the behavior of our code
    - Sometimes we have to "simulate & verify" things that don't even exist yet
    - The need for a bonus calculator didn't appear at the beginning in our "requirements gathering phase" 
    or whatever, it was "the business wants this BEHAVIOR, and our job is to make it happen in code"
- Testing is 
    - Does the thing work right?  "External code quality"
    - Are you building the right this? Verifying the business worthiness of something
    - The right code: reusable, understandable, expresses intent, fewest number of elements, duplication - "moist" or "rug' is best
    - The big core thing: LOOSE COUPLING
- *LOOSE COUPLING:*
    - Coupling is the "strength of relationships between code modules"
    - The ability to change one thing without breaking another
    - Chagning implementatin without changing interface
    - You have to DESIGN software this way. It isn't natural. You have to do it intentionally
- Write you code as if you're super skeptical that you or anybody else knows what the hel they are actuall doing
    - Because we don't often - things change over time. Bonuses get calculated differently later than they do now.
        - We need to assume our stuff is going to change, and we want to minimize the "blast radius"

- *"Hypothesis driven Development"*
    - "Cool story bro, what are a couple things we can do soon to see if this is something we want to invest it?"
- Query Builder, brace yourself if that's spoken of

**WE LOVE LOOSE COUPLING**

- Chaos Monkey is (for example) a thing in production that runs through production code and tries to break everything
